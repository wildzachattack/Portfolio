                      an Xtern, we would have professional development meet-ups once a week and have tech meet-up opportunities about every

                    <h4>IT Intern</h4>
                    <p>I helped build forms for people on the factory floor. These forms were for quality control. I built these forms on Oracle using some SQL.
                      I used Visual Basic and crated Excel templates that simplified creating Oracle forms. This cut the process time from about 1 hour of work
                      to 15 minutes of work. I led a training course for all the engineers and floor leads on how to use the templates to create new forms.</p>

                    <p>Built an educational game as a group project. I helped build parts of each minigame for this project. When
                      we finished this game at the end of the semester we allowed our professor to have access to the game we built.
                      We took this project on for a community center named St. Martin in Marion Indiana. We agreed to build an
                      educational game that this organization could use to increase learning in their class rooms.</p>
